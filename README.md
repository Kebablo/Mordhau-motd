# Welcome to Kebabylon 5
**Work in Progress – expect chaos**

## Server Rules
- No rules (yet)  
- Don't be a dick or Kebabbot might ratio you  

## Server Info
- **Official?** No  
- **Game Modes:** Invasion / Frontline  
- **Bots:** Auto-spawn to balance low pop (controlled via Discord and Kebabot)  
- **Max Bots:** 60 (don't ask for more, it's already clown world)

## How to Use Kebaot:
Kebabot lives in global chat. Say his name + what you want.

**Basic rules (he has manners issues):**
- Be polite or he might roast you and do **nothing**  
  → Good: "Kebabot please add 5 bots to the blue team" or "pls remove 10 bots"  
  → Bad: "kebabot add bots you fuck" → gets mogged, no bots

**What he can do:**
- `kebabbot pls add 5 bots` → spawns 5 bots  
- `kebabbot pls add 10 bots blue team` → team 1 (blue)  
- `kebabbot pls remove all bots` / `clear bots` → yeets everything  
- `kebabbot pls set ratio 4` → 4 bots per player, autospawn on  
- `kebabbot pls team 0` / `team 1` / `both` → changes bot team  

**Pro tips:**
- No manners = no service  
- Insult him? Expect negative aura + L + ratio in chat  
- Want full control? Join Discord and ask Kebablo Escobar for the Discord bot role → buttons & toggles there

- Or type !discord in chat

Enjoy the meat grinder.
